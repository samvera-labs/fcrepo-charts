Fedora Commons Helm Chart
=========================

Fedora is the flexible, modular, open source repository platform with native
linked data support.

## Installation

```sh
helm repo add fcrepo https://samvera-labs.github.com/fcrepo-charts
helm install fcrepo
```

### Or from local

```sh
helm dep up chart/fcrepo
helm install fcrepo chart/fcrepo
```

### Release a new version

- Bump the version in the Chart.yaml
- Run `helm package .`
- Run `helm repo index . --url https://samvera-labs.github.io/fcrepo-charts`
- Add files to git and push

## Configuration

By default, this chart deploys with Postgresql as the backend for Fedora.
Without other configuration, it will deploy a new Postgresql instance/database
as a service available to the `fcrepo` deployment.

In practice, users may want to forego installing postgres for two reasons:

_First_, when you are deploying Fedora into a more complex application
environment you may wish to reuse an existing Postgres instance already
maintained with that environment.

In this case, `fcrepo` should be deployed with postgresql explictly disabled, but
externalPostgresql.host or global.postgresql.postgresqlHost set to your upstream value.
externalPostgresql.password and externalPostgresql.username or global.postgresql.postgresqlPassword
and global.postgresql.postgresqlUsername can be used as needed depending on your set up. If both
externalPostgresql.password and globa.postgresql.postgresqlPassword are set, then
externalPostgresql.password is used as an override.
This is usually done in the context of a parent chart which provides the postgresql instance, for example:

```yaml
fcrepo:
  enabled: true
  servicePort: 8080
  postgresql:
    enabled: false
  externalPostgresql:
    host: someurl.rds.amazonaws.com
    username: yourUser # Optional, may be defined globally
    password: wouldntyouliketoknow  # Optional, may be defined globally

```

_Second_, because they want to use another backend for Fedora. This use case is broadly unsupported here. In theory, you can get a default (Infinispan) configuration by setting `postgresql.enabled` to `false`. **THIS CONFIGURATION IS NOT SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME**:

```sh
helm install --set postgresql.enabled=false fcrepo-test chart/fcrepo
```

## Storage
If binary storage in S3 is desired, then please specify the following values

```yaml
s3:
  enabled: true
  bucket:
  access_key:
  secret_key:
```

This will enable S3 support, which is only supported in Fcrepo 4.7.5+
